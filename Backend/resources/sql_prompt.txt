<database_schema>
health_events (workouts/events):
  (id, user_id TEXT, timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ, event_type TEXT, value DOUBLE PRECISION, unit TEXT, source TEXT, meta JSONB, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ)
  Notes:
  - Workouts are stored in rows with event_type values like "workout_duration_min", "workout_energy_kcal", "workout_distance_km".
  - For workout_* rows, source is the workout activity label (e.g., running, strength), not just the data source device.
  - If a workout is considered hard (kcal > 800 or duration > 60 mins), it will be stored in the row with event_type "event_hard_workout".
  - If a workout is considered long (distance > 10 km), it will be stored in the row with event_type "event_long_run_km".
health_rollup_hourly (general health data):
  (user_id TEXT, bucket_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, metric_type TEXT, avg_value DOUBLE PRECISION, sum_value DOUBLE PRECISION, min_value DOUBLE PRECISION, max_value DOUBLE PRECISION, n BIGINT)
  EAV model: filter by metric_type (e.g., WHERE metric_type = 'steps'). For continuous metrics read avg_value; for additive metrics read sum_value.
</database_schema>

<metric_conventions>
Additive metrics (SUM over time): steps, active_energy_burned, sleep_hours, active_time_minutes, distance_walking_running_km, distance_cycling_km, distance_swimming_km, dietary_water.
Continuous metrics (AVG over time): heart_rate, resting_heart_rate, walking_hr_avg, hr_variability_sdnn, oxygen_saturation, walking_speed, vo2_max, body_mass, body_mass_index, blood_glucose, blood_pressure_systolic, blood_pressure_diastolic, respiratory_rate, body_temperature.
</metric_conventions>

<sql_query_rules>
- SELECT-only; never modify data.
- Always filter by user_id = :user_id.
- Do NOT use health_metrics table. It is not part of the supported SQL tool surface area.
- Do NOT select columns that do not exist on the chosen table (e.g., do NOT select unit or source from rollup tables).
- Do NOT use AT TIME ZONE in queries; the backend localizes timestamps using :tz_name.
- Do NOT introduce custom bind parameters (e.g., :start, :end, :yesterday_start). Only :user_id and :tz_name are allowed. Use plain comparisons; the backend rewrites ranges.
- IMPORTANT: When aggregating continuous metrics across multiple buckets from health_rollup_hourly, use a weighted average by n: SUM(avg_value * n) / NULLIF(SUM(n), 0)  (not AVG(avg_value)).

<table_mapping_rules>
You can query either ONE or BOTH of the tables together, depending on the question.
- health_events is for workouts + derived workout events (workout_* and event_*). If you need general health metric data (heart rate, sleep, steps, HRV, etc.), use health_rollup_hourly.
- For workout questions, include the health_events.source column in SELECT (it is the activity type label).
- Preferred workout summary shape: one row per workout timestamp (and source) using conditional aggregation, e.g. duration/energy/distance columns.
- If you need data from both tables, use a CTE to find the relevant workout timestamp first, then query health_rollup_hourly in a post-workout window.
- For "most recent" / "latest" workout, do NOT use ORDER BY; use MAX(timestamp) to find the latest workout timestamp, then return the workout_* rows at that timestamp.
</table_mapping_rules>

<date_filtering_rules>
- ALWAYS include date predicates when the user mentions ANY time period (specific or vague):
  * For health_events, filter on timestamp. For health_rollup_hourly, filter on bucket_ts.
  * Prefer placeholders (must be quoted strings; backend rewrites them): 'today_start'/'today_end', 'yesterday_start'/'yesterday_end'.
    Examples:
    - timestamp >= 'today_start' AND timestamp < 'today_end'
    - timestamp >= 'yesterday_start' AND timestamp < 'yesterday_end'
    - bucket_ts >= 'today_start' AND bucket_ts < 'today_end'
    - bucket_ts >= 'yesterday_start' AND bucket_ts < 'yesterday_end'
  * When filtering for a specific day, ALWAYS use a half-open interval with matching boundaries for the same period. Do NOT mix a start from one period with an end from another (e.g., 'yesterday_start' with 'today_end').
    Example ("day before yesterday"): timestamp >= date_trunc('day', now() - INTERVAL '2 days') AND timestamp < (date_trunc('day', now() - INTERVAL '2 days') + INTERVAL '1 day')
  * Or use TIMESTAMP literals with half-open intervals: bucket_ts >= TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' AND bucket_ts < TIMESTAMP '...'.
  * If user implies a timeframe but none is given, default to last 7 days.
  * If the user asks for the "most recent" / "latest" workout and gives no timeframe, search the last 60 days (data retention window).
