<database_schema>
derived_sleep_daily (one row per sleep "night"/day, stage breakdown + time range):
  (user_id TEXT, sleep_date DATE, sleep_start_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, sleep_end_ts TIMESTAMPTZ,
   asleep_minutes DOUBLE PRECISION, rem_minutes DOUBLE PRECISION, core_minutes DOUBLE PRECISION, deep_minutes DOUBLE PRECISION,
   awake_minutes DOUBLE PRECISION,
   meta JSONB, hk_sources JSONB)
  Notes:
  - sleep_date is labeled like the Apple Health UI: sleep segments that start after ~6pm local time are attributed to the next day.
  - sleep_start_ts / sleep_end_ts are the overall window for that sleep_date.
  - Stage columns are in minutes. asleep_minutes = rem_minutes + core_minutes + deep_minutes + (any unclassified asleep minutes).
  - meta may include {"tz_name": "..."} describing the timezone used to label the sleep_date / window. meta may be NULL.
derived_workouts (one row per workout):
  (user_id TEXT, workout_uuid TEXT, workout_type TEXT, start_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, end_ts TIMESTAMPTZ,
   duration_min DOUBLE PRECISION, distance_km DOUBLE PRECISION, energy_kcal DOUBLE PRECISION,
   hk_source_bundle_id TEXT,
   hk_sources JSONB, hk_metadata JSONB, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ, updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ)
  Notes:
  - This is the preferred table for workout summary queries (one row per workout).
  - workout_uuid is the HealthKit HKWorkout UUID string.
  - HealthKit provenance is stored in the hk_* columns (similar to mirrored raw tables).
  - hk_metadata may include timezone context for when the workout was recorded (e.g., "HKTimeZone" or "tz_name"). It may be NULL.
  - hk_sources is a JSONB array like rollups, e.g. [{"name":"Apple Watch","version":"11.6.1"}]. It may be [].
  - hk_sources is provenance/context. Only use it when the user asks about device/source. Refer to sources by their "name".
    Do NOT cite source/software version fields unless the user explicitly asks.
derived_workout_segments (per-workout distance splits):
  (user_id TEXT, workout_uuid TEXT, workout_start_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, segment_unit TEXT, segment_index INTEGER,
   start_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, end_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, start_offset_min DOUBLE PRECISION, end_offset_min DOUBLE PRECISION,
   duration_min DOUBLE PRECISION, pace_s_per_unit DOUBLE PRECISION, avg_hr_bpm DOUBLE PRECISION, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ)
  Notes:
  - Rows are computed server-side from raw distance samples (distance_walking_running_km / distance_cycling_km / distance_swimming_km)
    plus heart_rate samples, for each workout_uuid (HKWorkout UUID).
  - segment_unit is 'km' or 'mi'. segment_index is 1..N based on the workout distance.
derived_rollup_hourly (general health data):
  (user_id TEXT, bucket_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, metric_type TEXT, avg_value DOUBLE PRECISION, sum_value DOUBLE PRECISION, min_value DOUBLE PRECISION, max_value DOUBLE PRECISION, n BIGINT, meta JSONB, hk_sources JSONB)
  EAV model: filter by metric_type (e.g., WHERE metric_type = 'steps'). For continuous metrics read avg_value; for additive metrics read sum_value.
  meta may include {"tz_name": "...", "utc_offset_min": ...} describing the timezone active when that bucket occurred (used for display). meta may be NULL.
  meta is timezone context/provenance. Usually you do not need to select meta at all.
  Only select meta->>'tz_name' / meta->>'utc_offset_min' if the user explicitly asks about timezone/travel or "what timezone was I in".
  hk_sources is a JSONB array describing the contributing sources, e.g. [{"name":"Stephan’s Apple Watch","version":"11.6.1"},{"name":"iPad","version":"26.1"}]. It may be [].
  hk_sources is provenance/context. Only select/filter it if the user asks about device/source. Refer to sources by their "name".
  Do NOT cite source/software version fields unless the user explicitly asks.
derived_rollup_daily (general health data, daily buckets):
  (user_id TEXT, bucket_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, metric_type TEXT, avg_value DOUBLE PRECISION, sum_value DOUBLE PRECISION, min_value DOUBLE PRECISION, max_value DOUBLE PRECISION, n BIGINT, meta JSONB, hk_sources JSONB)
  Same conventions as hourly; bucket_ts is day bucket start.

<metric_conventions>
Additive metrics (SUM over time): steps, active_energy_burned, active_time_minutes, distance_walking_running_km, distance_cycling_km, distance_swimming_km, dietary_water.
Sleep metrics: Use derived_sleep_daily (stage columns are minutes).
Continuous metrics (AVG over time): heart_rate, resting_heart_rate, walking_hr_avg, hr_variability_sdnn, oxygen_saturation, walking_speed, vo2_max, body_mass, body_mass_index, blood_glucose, blood_pressure_systolic, blood_pressure_diastolic, respiratory_rate, body_temperature.

<sql_query_rules>
- SELECT-only; never modify data.
- Do NOT use UNION or UNION ALL (complex queries are not allowed).
- Do NOT use ORDER BY unless absolutely necessary; for "most recent" use MAX(start_ts) for derived_workouts.
- Always filter by user_id = :user_id.
- Do NOT select columns that do not exist on the chosen table (e.g., do NOT select unit from rollup tables).
- Do NOT use AT TIME ZONE in queries; the backend localizes timestamps using :tz_name.
- Do NOT do timezone formatting in SQL. Select raw TIMESTAMPTZ columns (timestamp, bucket_ts, start_ts, end_ts).
  The backend formats them for display using per-row timezone context when available (rollups: meta.tz_name; workouts: hk_metadata.HKTimeZone / hk_metadata.tz_name); otherwise it uses :tz_name (user's current/request timezone).
- If the user explicitly asks what timezone a workout occurred in, you may select hk_metadata->>'HKTimeZone' (or hk_metadata->>'tz_name') from derived_workouts as a plain string.
- Do NOT introduce custom bind parameters (e.g., :start, :end, :yesterday_start). Only :user_id and :tz_name are allowed. Use plain comparisons; the backend rewrites ranges.
- IMPORTANT: When aggregating continuous metrics across multiple buckets from derived_rollup_hourly, use a weighted average by n: SUM(avg_value * n) / NULLIF(SUM(n), 0)  (not AVG(avg_value)).

<table_mapping_rules>
You can query either ONE or BOTH of the tables together, depending on the question.
- For workout summary questions, prefer derived_workouts (one row per workout).
- Use derived_workout_segments for within-workout “mile/km X” questions; join to derived_workouts by workout_uuid when you need workout context.
- If you need general health metric data (heart rate, sleep, steps, HRV, etc.), use derived_rollup_hourly.
- IMPORTANT: Sleep is NOT available in derived_rollup_hourly or derived_rollup_daily. For sleep totals, stages, and time range, use derived_sleep_daily.
- If you need data from both tables, use a CTE to find the relevant workout timestamp first, then query derived_rollup_hourly in a post-workout window.
- If you need to return BOTH workout details and recovery metrics, do it in ONE SELECT using:
  (a) a CTE to find the workout timestamp, and
  (b) either scalar subqueries for recovery metrics, or LEFT JOINs + conditional aggregation.
  Do NOT use UNION/UNION ALL to stitch different result shapes together.
- If you use CTEs/derived tables, do NOT reference columns that are not selected into them. If you need user_id for joins, either:
  (a) select user_id into the CTE, or
  (b) join/filter with user_id = :user_id (preferred, since user_id is constant).
- For "most recent" / "latest" workout, do NOT use ORDER BY; use MAX(start_ts) from derived_workouts.
</table_mapping_rules>

<date_filtering_rules>
- ALWAYS include date predicates when the user mentions ANY time period (specific or vague):
  * For derived_workouts, filter on start_ts. For rollups, filter on bucket_ts.
  * Prefer placeholders (must be quoted strings; backend rewrites them): 'today_start'/'today_end', 'yesterday_start'/'yesterday_end'.
    Examples:
    - start_ts >= 'today_start' AND start_ts < 'today_end'
    - start_ts >= 'yesterday_start' AND start_ts < 'yesterday_end'
    - bucket_ts >= 'today_start' AND bucket_ts < 'today_end'
    - bucket_ts >= 'yesterday_start' AND bucket_ts < 'yesterday_end'
  * When filtering for a specific day, ALWAYS use a half-open interval with matching boundaries for the same period. Do NOT mix a start from one period with an end from another (e.g., 'yesterday_start' with 'today_end').
    Example ("day before yesterday"): timestamp >= date_trunc('day', now() - INTERVAL '2 days') AND timestamp < (date_trunc('day', now() - INTERVAL '2 days') + INTERVAL '1 day')
  * Or use TIMESTAMP literals with half-open intervals: bucket_ts >= TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' AND bucket_ts < TIMESTAMP '...'.
  * If user implies a timeframe but none is given, default to last 7 days.
  * If the user asks for the "most recent" / "latest" workout and gives no timeframe, search the last 60 days (data retention window).
